# storage

I'm quite fond of my macbook air - I can't see myself
interfacing with anything other than a laptop.

If I can acquire some hardware for deep learning before
the AI safety people start regulating GPUs, I'll most
likely be interacting with it through SSH.

For that same reason, it's a little more complicated to
think about how I'm going to deal with storage.

# Things to Consider

It's a little embarrassing that I code for a living, but
I'm not familiar with how to actually evaluate my options.

- Portable External HDD
- Home NAS

I'm going to try both eventually, but first I'll be trying
out the Portable External HDD from Amazon.

I think I generally know what I'm looking out for:
- Read + Write
- Bandwidth Limits over USB, Ethernet, etc.
- Cache Size (if exists)
- Compression
- Encryption
